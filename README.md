# tumbledemerald

This is a decompilation of Pokémon Emerald, with many improvements and edits, similar to Rangi42's [polishedcrystal](https://github.com/Rangi42/polishedcrystal)

It builds the following ROM:

**tumbledemerald.gba**

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md), or run either `makerom` (for apt) or `makerom_pacman` (for pacman) to compile automatically.

Here is the current build status of the `master` branch.
