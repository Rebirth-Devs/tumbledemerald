# Cool people I ~~stole~~ *borrowed* code from:

- @ghoulslash: A lot of the features here are directly from [ghoulslash/pokeemerald](https://github.com/ghoulslash/pokeemerald.git) and its many amazing feature branches.
- Tutorial authors: Some features were adapted from code in the [tutorials](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/wiki/Tutorials/) in [pret](https://github.com/pret/)'s wiki.
- @pret: Without the amazing work done by the members of @pret to decompile and disassemble this game, this hack would not be possible.
- @AsparagusEduardo: Same as @ghoulslash, I pulled from their feature branches! 


# Cool people who put up with me on IRC:

- @sh4/@Daisyenryaku: you know why.
- @issotm: for running my awful sprite editing attempts through GIMP.
- @cosarara: for showing me how to use `CTRL`+`Shift`+`F` in vscode.

# Cool people who put up with me on Discord/GitHub:
- @Rangi42: sorry for sliding into ur dm's.
- @itsdarsh: keep being a legend.


# Other awesome people:

Anyone and everyone I possibly forgot!
